# Blackbird.io Mistral AI

Blackbird is the new automation backbone for the language technology industry. Blackbird provides enterprise-scale automation and orchestration with a simple no-code/low-code platform. Blackbird enables ambitious organizations to identify, vet, and automate as many processes as possible. Not just localization workflows, but any business and IT process. This repository represents an application that is deployable on Blackbird and usable inside the workflow editor.

## Introduction

Fast, open-source and secure language models. Facilitated specialisation of models on business use-cases, leveraging private data and usage feedback.

## Before setting up

## Actions

### Chat

- **Send prompt**: This action allows you to send a prompt to an AI model and receive its response. When you submit your message, it's processed and sent to the AI through our system. The AI then generates a response based on your input. If you've had a conversation history, it will be preserved and included along with the new AI response in the returned details

## Example

Using our application you can build the following bird:

![MistralAIExample](image/README/MistralAIExample.png)

First action:

![MistralAIExample](image/README/MistralAIExample-1-action.png)

Second action:

![MistralAIExample](image/README/MistralAIExample-2-action.png)

Third action:

![MistralAIExample](image/README/MistralAIExample-3-action.png)

As you can see, you can specify a message history to maintain the context of the conversation
